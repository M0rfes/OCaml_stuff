# Learning Notes - OCaml Programs

This directory contains detailed notes explaining what I learned from each OCaml program in this project.

## Organization

Each `.ml` file in the project has a corresponding `.md` file here documenting:
- What concepts the program teaches
- Key algorithms and techniques used
- OCaml features demonstrated
- Mathematical or computer science background
- How the code works

## Program Categories

### Algorithms & Data Structures
- **sieve.md** - Sieve of Eratosthenes prime number algorithm
- **rev.md** - Line reversal using list accumulation
- **radix.md** - Number base conversion with Horner's method

### Mathematical Visualizations
- **mandelbrot.md** - Fractal generation with complex number iteration
- **cardioid.md** - Parametric curves in polar coordinates
- **approx_pi.md** - Monte Carlo method for π approximation

### Graphics & Games
- **breakout.md** - Game physics and collision detection
- **main.md** - Turtle graphics with functors
- **plot.md** - 2D data visualization

### File I/O & System Programming
- **copy_file.md** - Character-by-character file copying
- **leap_year.md** - Boolean logic and date calculations

### Module System
- **angle.md** - Module signatures and abstract types
- **trutle.md** - Functors (parameterized modules)
- **draw.md** - Separation of concerns in game design
- **ttr.md** - Simple constant modules

### Basics
- **meme.md** - Hello World (every programmer's start!)

## Key Learning Themes

### OCaml Language Features
- **Module System**: Functors, signatures, abstract types
- **Functional Programming**: Immutability, recursion, higher-order functions
- **Mutable State**: Refs for when you need mutation
- **Pattern Matching**: Destructuring and case analysis
- **Exception Handling**: Control flow and error handling

### Computer Science Concepts
- **Algorithms**: Sieve of Eratosthenes, Monte Carlo methods, Horner's method
- **Data Structures**: Arrays, lists, tuples
- **Graphics**: Double buffering, coordinate systems, parametric curves
- **Game Development**: Game loops, physics, collision detection
- **Numerical Methods**: Approximation, iteration, convergence

### Software Engineering
- **Abstraction**: Abstract data types, module signatures
- **Separation of Concerns**: Logic vs. presentation
- **Code Reuse**: Functors for parameterized modules
- **API Design**: Clean interfaces, minimal but complete

## How to Use These Notes

1. **Learning**: Read the notes alongside the source code
2. **Review**: Use as reference when you forget a concept
3. **Teaching**: Share with others learning OCaml
4. **Inspiration**: See what other programs you could write

## Progress Tracking

These notes document your journey learning OCaml through hands-on programming. Each file represents:
- A problem solved
- A concept mastered
- A technique learned
- A step forward in your programming journey

Keep coding, keep learning!

# meme.ml - Hello World

## What I Learned

### The Simplest Program
The classic "Hello, World!" program - every programmer's first program.

### Key Concepts

1. **Basic Output**:
   - `Printf.printf` for formatted output
   - `\n` for newline character
   - Side effect of printing to stdout

2. **Top-Level Expression**:
   - `let () = ...` pattern for executing side effects at module load time
   - Unit type `()` indicates no meaningful return value
   - Runs when module is loaded/executed

### OCaml Features Used
- Printf module for formatted printing
- String literals
- Unit type and let binding for side effects

### Why "meme.ml"?
Likely named humorously - "Hello, World!" is a meme in programming culture, being the traditional first program in any language.

### Educational Value
Even this simple program teaches:
- How to run OCaml code
- Basic syntax
- Output to terminal
- Top-level expressions

### The Tradition
"Hello, World!" dates back to Brian Kernighan's 1972 tutorial for the B programming language and was popularized by K&R C book in 1978.

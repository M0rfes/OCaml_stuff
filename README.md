# The Litany Against Bugs

I must not segfault.
Segfault is the mind-crasher.
Segfault is the little-bug that brings total obfuscation.
I will face my bugs.
I will permit them to pass over me and through my Caml.
And when they have gone past,
I will turn the inner eye to see their trace in the stack.
Where the bug has gone, there will be nothing.
Only OCaml, my Caml, will remain.
